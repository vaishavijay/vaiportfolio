                Hello! Welcome to my corner of the internet!
                <br /><br />
                I am passionate about the intersection between humans and
                technology. My primary focus is on software development, machine
                learning, and artificial intelligence, but I am also invested in
                broadening my understanding of data science and UI/UX design. 
                <br /><br />
                Currently, I am at Northeastern's Seattle campus as one of
                eight Computer Science students selected for Northeastern
                University's inaugural Seattle Cloud Computing Program, in
                partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS), where I am learning 
                under AWS industry professionals, learning about Object-Oriented 
                Design & Data Science, and networking and gaining connections at this 
                Seattle Graduate campus and top companies like Amazon, Microsoft,
                Google, and more!
                <br /><br />
                I have experience in Data Analysis and Visualization through my
                most recent internship at Aspire Institute, where I analyzed
                data from Aspire Institute's alumni newsletter and weekly
                digests, provided insights on click rates, open rates, and
                content performance, suggested engagement strategy enhancements,
                collected and analyzed data, produced visualizations,
                dashboards, and reports, and collaborated effectively with team
                members to enhance presentation and visualization design.
                <br /><br />
                I am also interested in Machine Learning and Research
                Statistical Analysis, similar to what I did in my time at UCSD
                as an intern. I developed and implemented a Machine Learning
                model to analyze microbiota data, investigated correlations
                between altered GI microbiota and ASD symptoms, utilized data
                analysis on Weka to identify trends in bacteria classes and
                taxon levels associated with ASD symptoms, and presented my
                research and ML models at the 2022 UCSD MAP Symposium amongst
                UCSD staff and peers.
                <br /><br />
                I have experience in data analysis/visualization, web
                development/design, machine learning, UX/UI interface design,
                presentation building, leadership, and large-scale public
                speaking.
